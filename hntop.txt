* request comes in
* we fetch https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json
* we parse the top 10 or however many
* we check redis to see if we already know about any of the items
 - if not, look up the item: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/[X].json
 - pay attention to 'self' style posts - what URL do we get there?
* INCR a counter for the top item
* issue a 30X redirect

* possible future enhancements:
GET /X = get the Xth top ranked link (max of whatever our max is)
GET /about
